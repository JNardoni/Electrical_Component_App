# Electrical Component Tracking

As electricians look through a property, whether for planning a fix, expansion, or rework, they must record the different
electrical components located throughout. Outlets, sockets, overheads, etc. As opposed to writing these out on a notepad,
this app allows a user to do each of the steps quickly, including:

1. Create and store a new property
2. Add new rooms to said property
3. Add, remove, and comment on components on a room by room basis
4. Export the building to a PDF

All of this information is persistenetly stored in an SQLite database. This ensures that all information is saved and 
displayed accurately.
